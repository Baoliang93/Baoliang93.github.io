<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher with the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/), City University of Hong Kong. 

I received my PhD (May, 2022) in Computer Science from City University of Hong Kong supervised by [Dr. Shiqi Wang (ÁéãËØóÊ∑á)](https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/~shiqwang/). I received my M.S. degree in Intelligent Information Processing, Xidian University under the supervision of [Prof. Cheolkon Jung (Korea)](https://see.xidian.edu.cn/media/), in 2018, and B.S. degree in Electronic information science and technology, [Hefei University of Technology](https://www.hfut.edu.cn/), June 2015. 

My research interest includes image/video quality assessment and information forensics and security.
